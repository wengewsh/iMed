# iMed
iMed is a causal mediation analysis approach for latent subgroup strcture, where each mixture component corresponds to one latent subgroup in the linear strcutural equation model framework, in which the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm is used for estimating model parameters and singular Bayesian Information Criterion (sBIC) is usef for model selection.

# Three Examples
We provide three examples. 
The first example consists of 2 subgroups with different direction mediation effects and equal probabilities.  
The second example still consists of 2 subgroups with small but same direction mediation effects.  
The third example consists 3 subgroups with unequal probabilities and different direction mediation effects (positive, null and negative, respectively).
