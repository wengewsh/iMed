Heterogeneous Causal Mediation Analysis: EM algorithm for model parameters and singular BIC (sBIC) for model selection.
We provide three examples: the first example consists of 2 subgroups with different direction mediation effects and equal probabilities; 
the second example still consists of 2 subgroups with small but same direction mediation effects;  
the third example consists 3 subgroups with unequal probabilities and different direction mediation effects (positive, null and negative, respectively).
